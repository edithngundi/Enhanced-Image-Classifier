    "### Objective\n",
    "> In this mini-project, my focus is on developing an advanced image classification system using ensemble training. This marks the second iteration of creating an image classifier, and the primary goal remains unchanged â€“ evaluating the model's effectiveness in recognizing individuals of the same racial background.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The project aims to elevate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) through ensemble training, taking inspiration from the ensemble trees concept in XGBoost. This strategy involves merging two or more models, each with varying accuracy, to construct a composite model with enhanced performance. While there's no assurance of surpassing every individual model in the ensemble, the goal is to harness the strengths of each architecture, resulting in a model with commendable metric evaluation and versatile task performance. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> In the previous iteration, I developed a basic image classifier that fell short in performance due to the simplicity of the CNN architecture and the limitations of a small dataset comprising only 530 images. In this paper, I will make a comparative performance analysis of the previous simple CNN, a CNN trained on DenseNet169, a CNN trained on ResNet152, a CNN trained on VGG19, and the ensemble model. The models use a larger dataset of 2,000 images and have a more intricate architecture. \n",

    "> The dataset is sourced from my Google photos and enriched by contributions from the 4 individuals who willingly participated. Data augmentation techniques were applied to expand the dataset. As emphasized in my earlier mini-project, the individuals providing data have granted exclusive permission solely for the purposes of this assignment. I have upheld transparency by informing them that only the write-up and code will be uploaded to my GitHub repository. They are comfortable with their names being included in the write-up but have explicitly requested that only their facial features be utilized."

    "### Data Augmentation\n",
    "> Data augmentation is performed using the Augmentor library on images belonging to 4 individuals: Edith, Noni, Aroma, and Macbeth. The original images for each person are loaded using the `get_images` function, and an Augmentor Pipeline is created for each individual's directory. Various techniques are applied, including horizontal flipping, rotation, skewing, and zooming, with specific probability and factor parameters. The `sample` method is then utilized to generate a specified number of augmented images for each individual.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Additionally, a utility function `rename_files` is defined to rename the augmented images in each directory to ensure sequential numbering. This function takes a starting value and the path to the directory containing the files as parameters, sorts the files to maintain consistency, and iterates through them, renaming each file with a padded sequential number.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Each individuals's augmented images and original images are then saved in new folders - `EdithImages`, `NoniImages`, `AromaImages`, and `MacbethImages`. The renaming process is applied to maintain a sequential order for easy reference and organization in subsequent steps of the image classification process. `Edith's` images are named 0001 to 2500, `Noni's` are named 2501 to 5000, `Aroma's` are named 5001 to 7500, and `Macbeth's` are named 7501 to 10000."

    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "> After augmenting the dataset using various techniques, a crucial step involves cleaning the data prior to exploration and conversion. Locally, the images from `EdithImages`, `NoniImages`, `AromaImages`, and `MacbethImages` are consolidated into a folder named `FacesImages`. The `get_images` function systematically adds image paths to a list, while the `get_labels` function associates each image with a corresponding label. The earlier executed sequential naming during augmentation simplifies label assignment, with Edith's images (0001 to 2500) assigned the label 0, Noni's (2501 to 5000) assigned 1, Aroma's (5001 to 7500) assigned 2, and Macbeth's (7501 to 10000) assigned 3. The labels are converted to integers (0, 1, 2, and 3) to align with the model and loss function requirements, which operate on integer labels. The `create_dataframe` function creates a dataframe for subsequent data exploration. These steps play a vital role in ensuring the augmented dataset is properly organized before further conversion and model implementation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The original plan involved using the complete dataset of 10,000 images for each model's training. However, during the initial trial, training the classifier with the DenseNet169 pre-trained model on 7 epochs took an extended 3 hours, and accuracy computation on the testing set failed due to a kernel crash. Despite several attempts to adjust RAM and kernel settings, the ResNet152 and VGG19 pre-trained models consistently crashed the kernel when downloading trainable parameters, preventing them from completing the 1st epoch. Faced with these challenges, the approach was adjusted, and the models were subsequently trained with 2000 images each from the original dataset. Each model utilized a distinct set of 2000 images: `shorter_dataset1` for DenseNet169, `shorter_dataset2` for ResNet152, `shorter_dataset3` for VGG19, `shorter_dataset4` for the ensemble model, and `shorter_dataset5` for the simple CNN."

The `display_images` function enables a qualitative analysis by randomly selecting images and presenting them with corresponding labels in organized subplots. This approach offers insights into the dataset's diversity and characteristics regarding the 4 individuals. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is a valuable assessment of the dataset's image quality and clarity given that most of the images are augmented. This evaluation is crucial as the effectiveness of a machine learning model can be profoundly influenced by the quality of its input data. Additionally, it serves to confirm that the assigned labels accurately correspond to the content depicted in the images. \n",

    "### Data Conversion and Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `preprocess_images` function systematically reads and resizes images from the directory using OpenCV and generates a list of preprocessed images. This step is crucial because it ensures uniformity in image dimensions for effective model training. Subsequently, the `normalize_images` function transforms this list of preprocessed images into a NumPy array, ensuring pixel values are normalized. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> While the pre-trained models are originally trained on the `imagenet` dataset, the images underwent normalization using custom mean and standard deviation specific to each dataset. The imagenet `mean` and `standard deviation` values are `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`, respectively. As a general guideline, if the dataset being utilized shares characteristics with ImageNet, using its mean and standard deviation is recommended. However, for datasets with different characteristics, such as the five smaller datasets in this mini-project, custom mean and std calculations were conducted independently for optimal normalization.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> While this reduces the hue and color contrast on the images, specifically in the Predictions section, normalization ensures pixel values are standardized which prevents feature dominance. It also ensures faster model convergence during backpropagation. By dividing each pixel value by 255, the function ensures appropriate scaling for input into various image classification models, enhancing the overall readiness of the dataset for machine learning tasks. Additionally, this conversion is the preferred data format for the libraries and models in use."

    "> The dataset has been divided into `training` and `testing` sets using the `80-20` split. The training set (80%) is used to train the model, and the testing set (20%) is reserved for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. This helps ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen examples.\n",

    "> Within the `training` set, an additional `80-20` split has been performed to create a `validation` set. This is a strategy to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting. The validation set is not used for training but is crucial for tuning hyperparameters and assessing the model's performance on data it has not seen during training."

    "> Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consists of multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose in classification. There are two underlying hypotheses that we must assume when building any neural network: \n",

    "> - `Low dimensionality of the input space`. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> The data typically processed with CNNs doesnâ€™t usually satisfy either of these hypotheses. With the architecture of CNN, neurons of the hidden layers learn possible abstract representations over their input, which typically decrease its dimensionality (Baeldung, 2023). The network then assumes that these abstract representations, and not the underlying input features, are independent of one another. These abstract representations are normally contained in the hidden layer of a CNN and tend to possess a lower dimensionality than that of the input. A CNN thus helps solve the so-called `Curse of Dimensionality` problem, which refers to the exponential increase in the amount of computation required to perform a machine-learning task in relation to the unitary increase in the dimensionality of the input (Baeldung, 2023).\n"

    "> #### 1. Convolutional layers\n",
    "> To understand the underpinnings of this layer, it's important to look into the `filter` and two critical hyperparameters, `stride` and `padding`.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The `filter` also known as `kernel` is a small matrix used for the convolution operation. The `convolution operation` involves sliding the filter over the input data, performing element-wise multiplication at each step, and summing the results to produce a single value in the output feature map.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The dimensions of the filter depend on the channels of the image data points. If they are in `RGB`, then the channels are `3`. Therefore, the filter is a `3x3` matrix.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A convolutional layer typically uses multiple filters simultaneously. Each filter is responsible for capturing a different feature or pattern in the input data. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> During convolution, the filter slides from left to right and from top to bottom until it passes through the entire input image. The `stride` is the step the filter takes. Performing matrix multiplication with images represented as high-dimension matrices is computationally expensive (Antoniadis, 2023).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To reduce the load, `downsampling`, which is essentially reduces the spatial dimensions of the image, is often used. This operation is done by setting `stride > 0`. If this is set to `1` for instance, then the filter matrix will skip `1` row and `1` column as it slides over to perform the matrix multiplication. Given that the dataset in this project is comparatively small, downsampling was not performed.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In the convolutional layer, the pixels located on the corners and the edges are used much less than those in the middle. For instance, if the input image is a `5x5` matrix and the filter is a `3x3` matrix, as the filter slides on the image matrix, the input's central pixel at position `(3,3)` is used `9 times` while the corner pixels `(0,0)`, `(0,5)`, `(5,0)` and `(5,5)` are used `1 time` (Antoniadis, 2023).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Therefore, the information on the borders of images is not preserved as well as the information in the middle. A simple and powerful solution to this problem is `padding`, which adds rows and columns of zeros to the input image. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> If we apply padding $P$ in an input image of size $W{\\times}H$, the output image has dimensions $(W+2P){\\times}(H+2P)$. This is because the padding is added to the left, right, top and bottom of the input image matrix. In the example with a `5x5` matrix, if padding is set to $P=2$, then the resulting input image matrix is of dimensions `9x9`(Antoniadis, 2023). This is a complex step that I felt inexperienced to look into, so for this model the padding is set to `same` which ensures the output is the same dimension as the input.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The output of the convolutional layer is an output activation map which is computed using the following inputs (Antoniadis, 2023):\n",
    "> - An input image of dimensions $W_{in} \\times H_{in}$\n",
    "> - A filter of dimensions $k \\times k$\n",
    "> - Stride $s$\n",
    "> - Padding $p$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The resulting dimensions of the output activation map are:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> $$ W_{out} = \\frac{W_{in} - k + 2p + s} {s} $$\n",
    "> $$ H_{out} = \\frac{H_{in} - k + 2p + s} {s} $$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This task implements 'same' padding, where the size of the input is kept unchanged after the convolutional layer. So for this case:\n",

    ">\n",
    "> The dimensions of the input data and the parameters of the neural network play a crucial role. So this number can be controlled by the stacking of one or more pooling layers. Depending on the type of the pooling layer, an operation is performed on each channel of the input data independently to summarize its values into a single one and thus keep the most important features (Nanos, 2023).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The choice to use the max pooling technique was completely arbitrary. This technique first breaks down an input image matrix into submatrices of a specific dimension. For instance, if the input matrix is `4x4`, a suitable breakdown is having `4` submatrices that are of dimension `2x2`. These dimensions `2x2` are know as the `pool size`. I set a similar pool size for my model's max pooling layer.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Next, the technique chooses the maximum value from each of the 4 submatrices and constructs a `2x2` matrix with these values - hence why it's called max pooling.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This method maintains the most significant features of the input by reducing its dimensions. The mathematical formula of max pooling is (Nanos, 2023):\n",
    ">\n",
